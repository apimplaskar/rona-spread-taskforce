	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) is responsible for the major pandemic of the 21st century. We analyzed \&gt;4,700 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes and associated meta-data retrieved from public repositories. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 sequences have a high sequence identity (\&gt;99.9\%), which drops to \&gt;96\% when compared to bat coronavirus. We built a mutation-annotated reference {SARS}-{CoV}-2 phylogeny with two main macro-haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and \&gt;160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing a uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could complicate the design of future vaccines. The root of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes locates at the Chinese haplogroup B1, with a {TMRCA} dating to 12 November 2019 - thus matching epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2a originates in China and represents the major non-Asian outbreak. Multiple bottleneck episodes, most likely associated with super-spreader hosts, explain {COVID}-19 pandemic to a large extent.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
