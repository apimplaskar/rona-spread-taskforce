def generic_bfs_edges(G, source, neighbors=None, depth_limit=None):
    """Iterate over edges in a breadth-first search.

    The breadth-first search begins at `source` and enqueues the
    neighbors of newly visited nodes specified by the `neighbors`
    function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
        Starting node for the breadth-first search; this function
        iterates over only those edges in the component reachable from
        this node.

    neighbors : function
        A function that takes a newly visited node of the graph as input
        and returns an *iterator* (not just a list) of nodes that are
        neighbors of that node. If not specified, this is just the
        ``G.neighbors`` method, but in general it can be any function
        that returns an iterator over some or all of the neighbors of a
        given node, in any order.

    depth_limit : int, optional(default=len(G))
        Specify the maximum search depth

    Yields
    ------
    edge
        Edges in the breadth-first search starting from `source`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
    >>> print(list(nx.bfs_edges(G,0)))
    [(0, 1), (1, 2)]
    >>> print(list(nx.bfs_edges(G, source=0, depth_limit=1)))
    [(0, 1)]

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is from `PADS`_, which was in the public domain
    when it was first accessed in July, 2004.  The modifications
    to allow depth limits are based on the Wikipedia article
    "`Depth-limited-search`_".
